This is me and what makes me tick (FYI: "docuys" is pronounced as "Doc Ace").
An "outside the box thinker and doer". Electronics engineer (and 3 other post graduate degrees as well....which helped me discover how little I actually know!!) with a lifetime of hands on experience (and losing hair fast after circa 35+ years!) mostly as system engineer, but did the usual software and IT&C stint as well (mostly embedded realtime control system-like, as well as classical Management Information Systems). Nowadays helping managers (and organisations) solve the problems they created for themselves..... and ploughing what I learned back into the younger generations (if and when it is not the other way around: they teaching me!).
The enquiring mind is always dabbling with the latest and greatest, with crypto, blockchain and smart contracts in the near field at the moment. 
Is about to give the new "CX language" (a la Skycoin) a go (haven't done any serious programming for about a decade!). The purpose is to create a 'practicable', roadmap case study of how a real world Business app using CX is created. It should be so CLEAR and instructive that a business exec will be able to create one himself (without first having to obtain a Ph.D!). 

This a an effort to boost the Skycoin ecosystem, not only because I am an investor, but to support the concept of a decentralised internet AND to see whether and HOW blockchain technology can be applied successfully in a typical business scenario. I am going to need a lot of technical implementation support and hope that I'll be able to draw on help from other likeminded that support the stated objective (will have to define the goal VERY clearly and absolutely UNAMBIGUOUS!). Maybe this is the point where ideas may already come in very handy??
