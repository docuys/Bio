# Bio
This is me and what makes me tick (FYI: "docuys" is pronounced as "Doc Ace").
An "outside the box thinker and doer". Electronics engineer (and 3 other post graduate degrees as well....which helped me discover how little I actually know!!) with a lifetime of hands on experience (and losing hair fast after circa 35+ years!) mostly as system engineer, but did the usual software and IT&C stint as well (mostly embedded realtime control system-like, as well as classical Management Information Systems). 

Nowadays helping managers (and organisations) solve the problems they created for themselves..... and ploughing what I learned back into the younger generations (if and when it is not the other way around: they teaching me!).
The enquiring mind is always dabbling with the latest and greatest, with crypto, blockchain and smart contracts in the near field at the moment. Currently running 2 BTC full nodes and Lightning Network installed as well.

Is about to give the new "CX language" (a la Skycoin) a go (haven't done any serious programming for about a decade!). The purpose is to create a 'practicable', roadmap case study of how a real world Business app using CX is created. It should be so CLEAR and instructive that a business exec will be able to create one himself (without first having to obtain a Ph.D!). 

This a an effort to boost the Skycoin ecosystem, not only because I am an investor, but to support the concept of a decentralised internet AND to see whether and HOW blockchain technology can be applied successfully in a typical business scenario. I am going to need a lot of technical implementation support and hope that I'll be able to draw on help from other likeminded that support the stated objective (will have to define the goal VERY clearly and absolutely UNAMBIGUOUSLY!). Maybe this is the point where ideas may already come in very handy??

BUT, first I haave to get a new job to solve my current frustration with a situation that I cannot re-engineer! So, my CV to prospective interested employers.

Abbreviated curriculum vitae of Ian Uys (Dr JD Uys, Pr Eng):

-Hons.B.Eng (Stellenbosch University, South Africa) (Post-grad Honours Degree in Industrial Engineering & Quality Assurance, Cum Laude);
-M.Eng (Stellenbosch University, South Africa) (Post-grad Masters Degree in Industrial Engineering, Cum Laude);

A. Synopsis

1.	Ian has approximately 40 years experience as self employed system engineer, project manager, systems/operations manager, chief operating officer, engineering/technical manager, logistics systems engineer/manager, business analyst/process engineer, QA Systems Engineer and worked as system engineering/system management consultant in the defense and related industries (SANDF, Armscor and Denel Group) for most of his career. 

2.	He is/was also involved in the IT/ICT field, Radio Astronomy (Meerkat/SKA (Square Kilometer Array) SA), Power generation, Solar PV renewable energy, Mining, Telecommunications and Safety & Security areas. 

3.	He handled (as project manager & system engineer) several major software, hardware and facilities development and roll-out efforts. He is/was involved as system engineer and project manager in several major SITA (State Information Technology Agency),  software acquisition & development projects and is currently employed by the SA Navy. 

4.   He lectured (on an ad hoc basis on invitation) at the University of Pretoria (Project Management, System Engineering/System Management, QA Systems, Organization Design and Management and Business Process Reengineering) – mostly for graduate and post graduate students. 

5.	He developed several doctrinal frameworks and processes at the strategic, tactical and operational levels of business management. He is best known for his role in the research and development of Products System Management (PSM) in the SA National Defence Force and the ensuing course on PSM was developed and presented by him at the turn of the century. He developed and presents a systems management & system engineering course in the SA Navy. 

6.	His system design engineering expertise in Anti-Aircraft gun and missile air defense systems and related technologies as well as his published system management works are recognised internationally.

7.	He did several major Business Process Analysis, Modeling,  Reengineering and Performance Management & Improvement projects, including subsequent change management programs. 

8.	He is interested in and studies blockchain technology and the development and application of smart contracts in his spare time. He runs 2 Bitcoin full nodes and the Lightning Network on old laptops at home in support of the Btc network!

9.	He did numerous courses including Project & Engineering Management and QA Systems (PMBOK, Blanchard, Kerzner, Deming, et al). Assisted/Involved with several QA Systems, Configuration & Data Management, and Asset Management systems development and implementation.

10. 	He toys around with the programming & development of microprocessor embedded software and hardware, development of control systems, website design and hosting (HTML, CSS, Javascript and SQL) and more (mostly in C, PYTHON, GO (and lately CX) in Linux (Ubuntu, Mint) environments). 

11. 	He enjoys leading software development teams as he learned about complex software development projects the hard way during his career as consultant for SITA. Believes in open-sourcing and is not a Windows slave! He is au fait with most sw development methodologies/tools and technologies such as agile and scrum.

12.	He did consulting stints in Switzerland, Finland, Korea and England.

B. Prime areas of interest 

a.	High level, complex, multi-disciplinary system design, implementation and management (hardware & software), from user negotiations, user requirements definition and contracting, system conceptualization, design, and eventual qualification and fielding/rollout (i.e. the system engineering activities over the total life cycle) and subsequent readiness management.

b.	The application of a systems approach and or the application of systems engineering/management principles and methodologies in enterprise/business organizational improvement, and or process reengineering/optimization. 

c.	Participation/Implementation of system management processes and or participation in the operations management and or senior/strategic management of small to medium sized companies/enterprises.

d.	Programme/Project management/consulting in multi-disciplinary engineering, IT, ICT, Logistics, and other environments. 

e.	Life Cycle Integrated Logistic Support Management (as well as designing and implementation of logistics management processes/logistic engineering tasks as part of systems engineering).

f.	Training, lecturing, mentoring and coaching of upcoming, young professionals.

C. Remarks

a.	He URGENTLY needs a challenging well-paid job somewhere in the Western Cape (or for the right money, anywhere in the world), contracting, remote, are welcome.
b.	He operates “outside the box”, with at least 5+ years of active working career left.
c.	He believes in an integrative, participative style of working. 
d.	He enjoys and needs environments where challenges are aplenty and where he can lead and develop other people.
e.	He deeply embraces the development of the engineering talent of the future workforce in South Africa.
f.	He considers himself as a self starter, a leader of teams, energetic, a people motivator and manager in general. He is a people developer, coach and mentor.
g.	It is difficult to include all relevant detail of a long & multi-dimensional engineering career in a short summary.
