# Bio
This is me and what makes me tick.
An "outside the box thinker and doer". Electronics engineer (and 3 other post graduate degrees as well) with a lifetime of hands on experience (and losing hair fast after circa 35+ years) mostly as system engineer, but did the usual software and IT&C stint (mostly embedded realtime control systemslike, and classical Management Information Systems) as well. Nowadays helping managers solve the problems they created for themselves....
The enquiring mind is always dabbling with the latest and greatest, with crypto, blockchain and smart contracts being in the near field at the moment. 
Is about to give the new "CX language" (a la Skycoin) a go.
